# Lost Items Finder

Welcome to the Lost Items Finder project. This is a website that allows users to check lost items online. If a user finds an item they've lost, they can press a claim button to request the item. This request will be sent to the administrators of the site.

- **Claim Requests**: Users can press a claim button to request a lost item. This request is sent to the site administrators for approval.
